# How I Passed the OSCP in 6 Months

Passing the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) exam is a significant achievement in the field of ethical hacking and penetration testing. Here’s a detailed account of how I successfully completed the OSCP in just 6 months, outlining the resources and strategies I used along the way.

## 1. **Starting with the TCM Ethical Hacking Course**

I began my OSCP journey with the [TCM Ethical Hacking Course](https://www.tcmelearning.com/ethical-hacking). This course provided a solid foundation in ethical hacking principles and practical skills. It covered essential topics such as:

- **Reconnaissance and Enumeration**: Techniques for gathering information about target systems.
- **Vulnerability Analysis**: Identifying and analyzing vulnerabilities in systems.
- **Exploitation**: Gaining access to systems using various exploits.
- **Post-Exploitation**: Maintaining access and escalating privileges.

This course was crucial in building my foundational knowledge and practical skills, which were essential for the more advanced OSCP material.

## 2. **HTB Academy CPTs Path**

After completing the TCM course, I moved on to the [Hack The Box (HTB) Academy CPTs Path](https://academy.hackthebox.com/). This path was invaluable for deepening my understanding and applying what I had learned in a more structured environment. Key benefits included:

- **Structured Learning**: The CPTs Path provided a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to penetration testing.
- **Practical Labs**: Hands-on labs mimicked real-world scenarios, which was essential for developing practical skills.
- **Knowledge Checks**: Regular quizzes and challenges helped reinforce the material.

## 3. **OSCP Preparation**

With a strong foundation from the previous courses, I then focused on the OSCP-specific modules. Here’s how I approached them:

- **Complete OSCP Modules**: I diligently worked through all the OSCP modules, paying close attention to the detailed instructions and exercises provided.
- **OSCP Challenge Labs**: I tackled the OSCP challenge labs, which were critical for applying my skills in a controlled environment. I completed all labs except Skylark, which I found particularly challenging.

## 4. **TJNull's and Liankusanagi's Lists**

To further enhance my preparation, I utilized the following resources:

- **[TJNull's List](https://github.com/TJNull/OSCP-Resources)**: This list of additional resources and tips was instrumental in covering any gaps in my knowledge.
- **[Liankusanagi's List](https://github.com/liankusanagi/OSCP)**: Another valuable resource that provided insights into specific vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques.

## 5. **VulnLab and Practice**

Two resources that significantly contributed to my success were:

- **VulnLab**: [VulnLab](https://vulnlabs.com/) provided a range of vulnerable machines and scenarios that helped me practice and refine my skills.
- **Practice Environments**: Regular practice in various environments helped solidify my understanding and application of the techniques I learned.

## 6. **Key Takeaways**

- **Consistency is Key**: I dedicated time each day to studying and practicing, which was crucial for building and retaining skills.
- **Hands-On Practice**: Practical, hands-on experience with real-world scenarios was essential for preparing for the OSCP exam.
- **Utilize Resources Wisely**: Leveraging various resources, including courses, labs, and lists, provided a well-rounded preparation strategy.

## Conclusion

The journey to passing the OSCP was challenging but rewarding. By following a structured approach and utilizing a combination of courses, labs, and additional resources, I was able to prepare effectively and pass the exam within 6 months. For anyone preparing for the OSCP, I recommend a similar approach: build a strong foundation, practice extensively, and leverage available resources to enhance your preparation.

Good luck on your OSCP journey!
