**I'm Aditya, also known as warranty\_v01d in the hacker community.**

As a certified OSCP and a Computer Science student, I'm passionate about ethical hacking and cybersecurity. Join me as I continue pushing boundaries, exploring new vulnerabilities, and breaking limits (and warranties).

With the OSCP under my belt, the journey doesn't stop here as there's always more to discover
